# WhoIsWho
This a Javascript (with help of p5), HTML5 and PHP project that the idea is play the game "Who is Who?" or a copy of that

ATTENTION: you should change the databases used in PHP, also the data in them. The game is pre-defined to find 4 users but can have much more.
I have a table "TodosFuncionarios", that contains all the people to make answers about it.
Table "Perguntas", have all the questions.
Table "perguntas_possibleanswers", have the answers of all the users and shows it when necessary in game.
Table "RespostasCertas", shows the right answer to each question of each person.
